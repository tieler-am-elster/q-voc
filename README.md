# q-voc
**Q-VOC (say: cu vowk) is a free and open-source flashcard/vocabulary card managing and language learning application** built entirely using Python. Currently **it's under heavy development** of a first command-line prototype, but there are some plans for the app. Here a some examples:
- Plugin developing and integrating system
- Reminders
- Quizes, repeats and refreshes
- Pronounciation learning through hearing and repeating
- CSV imports

**The ultimate goal** is to create a free and open-source **full-featured and competitive language learning app**. There are **no plans** on creating a mobile version, so that the app would remain ad-free, and open-source.

Any help is appreciated.
